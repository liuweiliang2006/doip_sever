 * @section [global]
 * Violates MISRA 2012 Advisory Directive 4.9, A function should be used in preference
 * to a function-like macro where they are interchangeable.
 * Function-like macros are used instead of inline functions in order to ensure
 * that the performance will not be decreased if the functions will not be
 * inlined by the compiler.
